# PhD dissertation

My PhD thesis from 2017 is archived in this repository.
Much to my surprise I realized that, after a couple of years, it still builds without error.
You can simply run `latexmk -pdf Dissertation.tex` for that purpose.
The PDF with the official version can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-a-010835772).
