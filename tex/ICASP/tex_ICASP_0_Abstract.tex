The application of hierarchical models for assessing the compressive strength of structural masonry is investigated.
Based on current codified models the distribution of compressive strengths within an ensemble of masonry wall specimens
is related to the statistical properties of the populations of brick units and mortar used.
The parameters of this relation are calibrated with test data acquired at ETH Z\"{u}rich.
This approach allows for heterogeneous material modeling, consistent uncertainty management and optimal information processing.
Costly compression tests of full-size masonry and inexpensive tests of brick and mortar samples are jointly utilized for learning about the masonry wall characteristics.
